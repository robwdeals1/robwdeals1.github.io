        Seagull, you fly across the horizon
        Into the misty mornin' sun
        Nobody asks you where you are going
        Nobody knows where you're from

        Here is a man asking the question
        Is this really the end of the world?
        Seagull, you must have known for a long time
        The shape of things to come

        Now you fly, through the sky never asking why
        And you fly all around 'til somebody, shoots you down,

        Seagull you fly away
        And you fly away today
        And you fly away tomorrow
        And you fly away, leave me to my sorrow

        Seagull go and fly
        Fly to your tomorrow, leave me to my sorrow, fly
